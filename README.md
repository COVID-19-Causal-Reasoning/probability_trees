# Algorithms for Causal Reasoning in Probability Trees
*By the AGI Safety Analysis Team @ DeepMind*

Probability trees are one of the simplest models of causal generative processes.
They possess clean semantics and are strictly more general than causal Bayesian
networks, as they are able to e.g. represent causal relations that causal Bayesian
networks cannot. Yet, they have received little attention from the AI and ML
community. Here we present new algorithms for causal reasoning in discrete
probability trees that cover the entire causal hierarchy (association, intervention,
and counterfactuals), and operate on arbitrary propositional and causal events. Our
work expands the domain of causal reasoning to a very general class of discrete
stochastic processes.
